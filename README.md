# Design Choices 
 
 ## Colors

 I initially was quite stuck on picking a color palette, I picked some basic red and orange colors and used the color wheel to get more detailed shades I felt matched.
 I first had color palette of
 * #efbb0fc1
 * #f57e23
 * #e0770c
 * #ffff4a
 * #9565q8
 * e3f0e4
 
 
 Toward the end of compeleting my project, I was not extremelly happy with how everything was looking together. Something about it wasnt sitting right with me.
I decided to add a background color to the DIVS in the main body for about us, price list, and contact us. To pick the color for the background I used color dropper to take the 2 shades of brown from the paw prints in the header. This left me with 2 colors. 
 * #d0867c
 * #bf786a


I added these colors to the divs, and then my font color was hard to read (#e0770c). For convinence until I decided to change the font color in the body to white #ffffff. This was a temporary move while I contemplated my color palette. 
 ### My inital color palette

 ![headeranddivorange](assets/readme-images/firstheader-firstdiv.png "First header and div")
 ![firstfooter](assets/readme-images/firstfooter.png "first footer")
 I was not happy with the way the colors above highlighted eachother, and felt it was too much on the eye of the user. 

 I decided to use colormind to help with a decision. I uploaded the picture of the paw print, and generated a few different pallets, although these pallets were very dark. See example of dark color palette.

 I decided to try search for a pallet that holds a similar color too #d0867c
 This left me with a palette of 
 * f6f9f7
 * b1bdba
 * f78061
 * dd9273
 * 3d4b47

 ### My final color palette 
 
 I tested out multiple different combinations of the palette I chose, and finally decided which color for which aspect. 
 ![Header](assets/readme-images/used-header.png "My header")
 ![nav](assets/readme-images/nav-bar.png "My nav bar")
 ![Mav hover](assets/readme-images/nav-bar-hover.png "My nav bar :hover")
 ![about us](assets/readme-images/about-us.png "about us")
 ![body](assets/readme-images/used-body.png "body")
 ![form:hover](assets/readme-images/form-hover.png "Hover over submit on form")
 ![form:no email](assets/readme-images/formnoemail.png "form submit with no email")
 ![form:no number](assets/readme-images/formnonumber.png "form submit no number")

 ## Typography 
 This website uses the fonts Kaushan Script, and Lemonada, which were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I used both of these fonts in cursive as I think its adds an elegance to the website. I used Kaushan Script in cursive for my headings and the nav bar as I felt with letter spacing these would be easy to read and would not be off putting as they are not chunks of text. 
 I used Lemonada in cursive for all other element of the webiste, although the font is cursive, it holds a very slight slant. I find this easy to read as well as matching Kaushan Script cursive, as they both hold a slant. 

 ## Imagery
 The imagery used in the website is used to make the user aware from the get go, this is a website to do with animals (especially dogs). From the paw prints in the header, to the image of a dog groomer showing another younger woman the way. This image was used to show Scamps is a family run business with good connection within. I used the image of a dog in the bath next to the price list, as having a bath is included in most grooms. I would have liked to have a gallery of some before and after pictures, although I could not achieve this with the free images available online. I used a fun image of a dog on my form submittion page, there is nothing to do on the submission page and I thought this image added to the page well.

 ### Limitations
 . . I found that Chrome dev tools was a great help to see the placement of items and for using smaller screens, although I found once I had deployed my website and I started opening it on my own device, and asking family and friends to check out my website on any and all devices in their homes it wasnt working to same extent as it shows on the dev tools. I found this may be due to the fact most phones are touch screens. For eg, my nav bar was very difficult to use on actual phones, although from the dev tools this wouldnt have been noticed. 

 I found another limitation to be finding photos of dog grooming, before and after pictures. A lot of photos that could have been used I would have to pay for. I mainly sourced my images from pexels for free. 

I found in the deployment if my website onto phone screens, that samsung phone were giving a horizontal scroll bar, but it has no use unless you zoomed into the website. I did not find this on any iPhone that my project was opened on. I used dev tools, and my very own class mentor Simen Daehlins very useful extension Unicorn revealer to show what the issue may have been. It seems the nav bar was my issue. I attepted to fix same.

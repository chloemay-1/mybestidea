# Scamps Groomers
This website was designed to provide users with information about a dog groomers called Scamps. This website should be easy to navigate and have easy flow for users. Users should be able to find treatment and prices easily, with help from a navagation bar. This website should hold images of work done and a map of location.


I plan on attaching a form for users to add their details and dogs details, and our team will get back to them to arrange an appointment. Alternatevly call the number, email us, or drop by the store and we will be happy to help.  I hope to acheive this.

# Design Choices 
 
 ## Colors

 I initially was quite stuck on picking a color palette, I picked some basic red and orange colors and used the color wheel to get more detailed shades I felt matched.
 I first had color palette of
 * #efbb0fc1
 * #f57e23
 * #e0770c
 * #ffff4a
 * #9565q8
 * e3f0e4
 <img src=(assets/readme-images/header.png)>
 <img src=(assets/readme-images/header-firstdiv.png)>
 <img src=(assets/readme-images/footer.png)>
 

 Toward the end of compeleting my project, I was not extremelly happy with how everything was looking together. Something about it wasnt sitting right with me. I decided to add a background color to the DIVS in the main body for about us, price list, and contact us. To pick the color for the background I used color dropper to take the 2 shades of brown from the paw prints in the header. This left me with 2 colors. 
 * #d0867c
 * #bf786a


 I added these colors to the divs, and then my font color was hard to read (#e0770c). For convinence until I decided to change the font color in the body to white #ffffff. This was a temporary move while I contemplated my color palette. 
 I decided to use colormind to help with a decision. I uploaded the picture of the paw print, and generated a few different pallets, although these pallets were very dark. 
 . I decided to try search for a pallet that holds a similar color too #d0867c
 This left me with a palette of 
 * f6f9f7
 * b1bdba
 * f78061
 * dd9273
 * 3d4b47
 

 I tested out multiple different combinations of the palette I chose, and finally decided which color for which aspect. 

 ### Limitations
 . . I found that Chrome dev tools was a great help to see the placement of items and for using smaller screens, although I found once I had deployed my website and I started opening it on my own device, and asking family and friends to check out my website on any and all devices in their homes it wasnt working to same extent as it shows on the dev tools. I found this may be due to the fact most phones are touch screens. For eg, my nav bar was very difficult to use on actual phones, although from the dev tools this wouldnt have been noticed.

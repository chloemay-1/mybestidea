# Scamps Groomers
This website was designed to provide users with information about a dog groomers called Scamps. This website should be easy to navigate and have easy flow for users. Users should be able to find treatment and prices easily, with help from a navagation bar. This website should hold images of work done and a map of location.


I plan on attaching a form for users to add their details and dogs details, and our team will get back to them to arrange an appointment. Alternatevly call the number, email us, or drop by the store and we will be happy to help.  I plan on having a reviews box so people can leave reviews if they wish.
I hope to acheive
